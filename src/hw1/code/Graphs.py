# 3. (4 points) A plot of log(lamda) against the squared error in the training data.


# 4. (4 points) A plot of log(lamda) against the squared error in the test data.

# 5. (3 points) A plot of lambda against the number of nonzero coefficients.

# 6. (2 points) A brief commentary on the task of selecting lambda
